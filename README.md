### About my project - 
Fifa 22 is a video game that is played on consoles
- Xbox 
- Ps4/5
- Pc 

Fifa is made by Ea (electronic Arts) sports and is best known for there game Madden and Fifa, Fifa is a game that is a replica of football it's self, but specifaclly my project is about Fifa 22 (the newest edition of Fifa) 22 is a very advanced game from others, in my project i show in game features, gameplay photos, and in game currency. Fifa is a game that lets you play with friends and on the go!

### My design process

- Colour
  - I got my imagine from FIFA 22 website front page and used the colours from that image.
  - The website i got the colours for this is [**colourexplorer.com**](http://www.colorexplorer.com/imageimport.aspx)

- Layout
  - my layout was based on the game itself, in the actual game there are four pages - Gamemode, Online, Store and settings. From there i decided to have four pages - Home, Images, a trailer and store. 

- Media
  - All my media was found at [**EAsportsFifa**](https://www.youtube.com/c/easportsfifa)

- Visual Code
  - i used alot of divs and used HTML aswell as Css as my desgining sheet.

### Things i can do differently next time
- Use grid instead of Css to have a nicer layout
- Have a better work folder to find things easier 
- if i use Css next time, put more work into making the Css File more advanced
